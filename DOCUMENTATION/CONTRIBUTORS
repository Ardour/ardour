In addition to those listed in the AUTHORS file, the following people
are among those who offered financial support, design insights and
ideas, encouragement, feedback, bug reports and much more during
Ardour's pre-release development. They generally suffered from days of
frustration, and withstood hundreds of CVS revisions without
complaint. 

No thanks or praise is sufficient for their contributions to Ardour.

I would particularly like to recognize:

Frank Carmickle
       - first financial supporter of Ardour, 
         instigator of ardour/ksi.

Ron Parker (Minneapolis, MN)
       - first user of Ardour in a commercial studio,
         financial contributor, major initiator of
         MTC and MMC functionality.

DuWayne Holsbeck
       - an early financial and infrastructure sponsor

Havoc Pennington & Owen Taylor 
       - provided much assistance in understanding, diagnosing and
         cajoling GTK+.

Tom Pincince (Shasta, CA)
       - provided continuous, excellent design insights and
         rationalizations, as well as info on the operation of some
         existing DAW's.

I would also like to thank Jim Hamilton of Rittenhouse Recording,
Philadelphia, for the partnership, friendship and foresight he showed
in allowing me to use the studio as the development basis for
Ardour. I met Jim playing a jazz drumkit at a fundraiser to celebrate
the 30th anniversary of our children's nursery school. Since then, he
has continued to open my eyes to both music itself, the process of
making music, and the life of a working musician. Jim's the best and
most inventive percussionist I have ever seen, and one of the best
I've ever heard. He has always believed in the social and philosphical
implications of Ardour, and his support and interest have been vital
in Ardour's development. Although as of this writing, Rittenhouse
Recording is not running Ardour, its only a matter of time!
