# üîÑ **Development Workflow & Decision Matrix**

## üìã **Overview**

This document establishes the development workflow and decision-making process used in this project, aligned with Ardour's official development practices. All justified code changes have been applied and are working correctly.

**Reference:** [Ardour Development Guide](https://ardour.org/development.html)

## üèóÔ∏è **Ardour Architecture Context**

### **Codebase Overview**

- **Total Size**: ~160,000 lines of code
- **UI Layer**: ~48,000 lines (gtkmm C++ wrapper around GTK+)
- **Backend Engine**: ~34,000 lines
- **Architecture**: Heavy use of async signal/callback system for anonymous coupling
- **Pattern**: Model-View-Controller (MVC) programming model

### **Development Philosophy**

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Core development happens on IRC for real-time discussions
- **No Formal Roadmap**: Development is iterative and discussion-driven
- **Minimal Documentation**: Doxygen-generated docs, technical notes for specific areas
- **Community-Driven**: Bug/feature tracking, mailing lists for involvement

---

## üéØ **Core Principles**

### **1. Minimal Code Changes**

- ‚úÖ Only modify code when **absolutely necessary**
- ‚úÖ Prefer build system solutions over code changes
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables and configure flags first
- ‚úÖ Respect the existing async signal/callback architecture

### **2. Justified Changes Only**

- ‚úÖ Platform compatibility issues with no clean alternative
- ‚úÖ Build system bugs that affect functionality
- ‚úÖ Header conflicts that break compilation
- ‚úÖ Plugin system integration (respecting non-sandboxed approach)
- ‚ùå Environment-specific workarounds
- ‚ùå Platform-specific guards for non-platform issues

### **3. Clean Alternatives First**

- ‚úÖ Build system flags (`--boost-include`, `--also-include`)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables (`CPPFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS`)
- ‚úÖ pkg-config and standard build practices
- ‚úÖ Leverage existing async callback mechanisms
- ‚ùå Hardcoded paths in wscript files
- ‚ùå Platform-specific code wrapping

## üîç **Decision Matrix**

### **When to Modify Code**

| Issue Type                 | Justification                   | Example                            | Status     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Platform Compatibility** | No clean alternative exists     | macOS/Clang alias attributes       | ‚úÖ Applied |
| **Build System Bug**       | Affects core functionality      | YTK/GTK2 library linking           | ‚úÖ Applied |
| **Header Conflict**        | Breaks compilation              | FluidSynth internal/system headers | ‚úÖ Applied |
| **Plugin Integration**     | Headless VST support needed     | VST plugin loading in headless     | ‚úÖ Applied |
| **Environment Issue**      | Can be solved with build system | Missing Boost headers              | ‚ùå Avoided |
| **Platform-Specific**      | Not actually platform-specific  | Windows code wrapping              | ‚ùå Avoided |

### **When to Use Build System**

| Issue Type               | Solution               | Example                 | Status      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| **Missing Dependencies** | `--boost-include` flag | Boost headers not found | ‚úÖ Resolved |
| **Include Path Issues**  | `--also-include` flag  | libarchive headers      | ‚úÖ Resolved |
| **Library Path Issues**  | Environment variables  | Homebrew library paths  | ‚úÖ Resolved |
| **pkg-config Issues**    | `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`      | libarchive detection    | ‚úÖ Resolved |

## üìä **Applied Changes Summary**

### **Justified Code Changes (Applied)**

1. **YTK/GTK2 Build Fix** - Conditional library linking in `gtk2_ardour/wscript`
2. **FluidSynth Headers** - Internal header path in `fluidsynth_priv.h`
3. **VST Headless Support** - Plugin loading and processing in headless mode

### **Environment Solutions (Applied)**

1. **Boost Headers** - `--boost-include=/opt/homebrew/include`
2. **libarchive Headers** - `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable
3. **General Includes** - `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` environment variables

### **Avoided Changes**

1. **Windows Code Wrapping** - Fixed real root causes instead
2. **Build System Path Mods** - Used existing flags and environment
3. **Platform-Specific Guards** - Not actually platform-specific issues
4. **Plugin Sandboxing** - Respecting Ardour's non-sandboxed plugin approach

## üîÑ **Development Process**

### **1. Issue Identification**

```bash
# Build fails with specific error
./waf build
# Error: 'some_header.h' file not found
```

### **2. Root Cause Analysis**

```bash
# Check if it's a dependency issue
brew list | grep package_name
# Check if it's a path issue
pkg-config --cflags package_name
# Check if it's an architecture issue
# (async callbacks, MVC patterns, etc.)
```

### **3. Solution Selection**

```bash
# Try environment variables first
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/lib"

# Try build system flags
./waf configure --boost-include=/opt/homebrew/include

# Only modify code if no clean alternative exists
# Respect existing async callback architecture
```

### **4. Validation**

```bash
# Test the solution
./waf clean
./waf configure
./waf build
```

## üö´ **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

### **1. Platform-Specific Code Wrapping**

```cpp
// ‚ùå DON'T: Add platform guards for non-platform issues
#ifdef _WIN32
// Windows-specific code
#endif

// ‚úÖ DO: Fix the actual root cause
// Usually missing dependencies or environment issues
```

### **2. Hardcoded Paths in Build System**

```python
# ‚ùå DON'T: Hardcode paths in wscript files
obj.includes = ['/opt/homebrew/include']

# ‚úÖ DO: Use environment variables and flags
./waf configure --also-include=/opt/homebrew/include
```

### **3. Environment-Specific Workarounds**

```cpp
// ‚ùå DON'T: Add workarounds for environment issues
#ifdef __APPLE__
// macOS-specific workaround
#endif

// ‚úÖ DO: Fix environment setup
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
```

### **4. Plugin Sandboxing (Ardour-Specific)**

```cpp
// ‚ùå DON'T: Implement plugin sandboxing
// Ardour explicitly doesn't sandbox plugins for performance reasons

// ‚úÖ DO: Follow Ardour's plugin architecture
// Direct plugin loading with proper error handling
```
