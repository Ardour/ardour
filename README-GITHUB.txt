Github release tarballs are not supported by Ardour
===================================================

This information applies to bundles automatically generated by
https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/releases

Ardour's program version is maintained using git-tags. Compiling Ardour depends
on `git describe` (a full git clone is needed for this) or alternatively a
version-file in the release-dist. Github cannot provide the latter and also
does not allow to inject a version-file during export archiving.
