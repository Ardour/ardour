.SH DESCRIPTION
Ardour is a multichannel hard disk recorder (HDR) and digital audio 
workstation (DAW).
It is capable of simultaneous recording 24 or more channels of 32 bit audio at
48kHz.
Ardour is intended to function as a "professional" HDR system, replacing
dedicated hardware solutions such as the Mackie HDR, the Tascam 2424 and more
traditional tape systems like the Alesis ADAT series.
It is also intended to provide the same or better functionality as software 
systems such as ProTools, Samplitude, Logic Audio, Nuendo and Cubase VST (we 
acknowledge these and all other names as trademarks of their respective 
owners).
It supports MIDI Machine Control, and so can be controlled from any MMC
controller, such as the Mackie Digital 8 Bus mixer and many other modern
digital mixers.
