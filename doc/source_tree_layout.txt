Ardour Source-Tree layout (July 2017)

===== LIBRARIES =====
 A collection of libraries and utility functions. While most are shared
 libraries, they're pretty much exclusive to Ardour.

libs/

 **** Independent libs ****

 - fluidsynth
   Stripped down (library only) and slightly customized version of fluidsynth
   use  tools/update_fluidsynth.sh to update from upstream

 - appleutility
   Utility Classes, abstraction for CoreAudio and AudioUnits (OSX, macOS)

 - ardouralsautil
   Utility Class for device-listing (used by the jack and  ALSA backends).
   Device-reservation comandline tool (linked against libdbus), which is
   also available from https://github.com/x42/alsa_request_device

 - hidapi
   Unmodified https://github.com/signal11/hidapi for interaction with some
   control surfaces (Push2, NI Maschine)

 - libltc
   Unmodified https://github.com/x42/libltc/ for Linear Timecode en/decoding

 - ptformat
   Unmodified https://github.com/zamaudio/ptformat for loading ProTools sessions

 - vfork
   A exec-wrapper which redirects file-descriptors to be used with vfork(2)

 - qm-dsp
   Stripped down version of https://github.com/c4dm/qm-dsp
   The Queen Mary DSP library is used by VAMP Plugins

 - vamp-plugins
   VAMP plugins for audio analysis and offline processing (uses qm-dsp)

 - temporal
   various utility code for dealing with different kinds of time,
   including Timecode (FPS) and musical time conversions

 - lua
   Lua Script interpreter and C++ class abstraction
   - libs/lua/lua-5.3.3 is unmodified upstream Lua-5.3.3
   - libs/lua/LuaBridge is a highly customized version of
     https://github.com/vinniefalco/LuaBridge (C++ bindings)

 - plugins
   LV2 Plugins included with Ardour. These are currently mostly
   independent (a-fluidsynth uses libfluidsynth)

 - clearlooks-newer
   GTK theme engine (used by gtk2_ardour)


 **** PBD dependent libs ****

 - pbd
   Paul B-D's utility classes. This is the basis for all Ardour specifics.
   It provides basic concepts and OS abstractions.

 - evoral
   (uses libpbd)
   Control events, control lists, automation evaluation,
   parameter descriptions, incl MIDI event abstraction

 - midi++2
   (uses libpdb, libevoral)
   Standard MIDI Files I/O

 - backends
   (uses libpdb, ardouralsautil | appleutility, implements libardour interface)
   Interaction with Operating System's Audio/MIDI API:
   ALSA, CoreAudio, JACK, PortAudio/ASIO

 - surfaces
   (uses libpbd, libevoral, libtimecode, libardour ;; libgtkmm2ext, libcanvas)
   Control Surfaces, dynamically loaded by libardour on runtime.

 - panners
   (uses libpdb, implements libardour interface)
   Pan plugins (stereo-balance, VBAP, etc) are dynamically loaded at runtime.

 - audiographer
   (uses libpdb)
   Mini Ardour inside Ardour to export audio-files from sessions.

 - fst
   (uses libpbd, implements external methods for libardour and gtk2ardour)
   VST scanner tool and abstraction for Windows-VSTs to be used with
   wine or actual windows.

 - ardour
   (uses pretty much all the libs above)
   This is it. libardour runs Ardour sessions.

 **** UI related libs ****

 - gtkmm2ext
   (uses libpbd)
   Utility Library to extend GDK, GTK, and basic abstraction for UIs
   and event-loops. This library is not limited to the GUI, but also
   used for other graphical interfaces (e.g. Push2, NI Maschine)

 - canvas
   (uses libpbd, libgtkmm2ext)
   Cairo Canvas, provides a slate for scalable drawing and basic layout/packing

 - widgets
   (uses libpbd, libgtkmm2ext ;; libcanvas utils/colors)
   Custom GUI widgets

 - waveview
   (uses libpbd, libgtkmm2ext, canvas,  libardour)
  Threaded waveform rendering
