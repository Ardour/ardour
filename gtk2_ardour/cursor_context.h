   A scoped handle for changing the editor mouse cursor.

   This is a safe way to change the cursor that ensures it is only modified in
   a strict stack-like fashion.  Whenever this handle goes out of scope, the
   cursor is restored to the previous one.

   This is not quite entirely fool-proof, there is one case to be careful of:
   if a cursor context handle exists, to change it, you must first reset that
   handle (destroying the context) then set it.  Assigning a new context to a
   non-NULL handle will create the new context (pushing a cursor), then destroy
   the old one, which would attempt to pop a non-top context which is an
   error.  To account for this, when replacing a possibly existing context, use
   set() which will automatically do the right thing.
