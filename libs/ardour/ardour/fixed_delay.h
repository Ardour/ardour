/** Multichannel Audio/Midi Delay Line

 * This is an efficient delay line operating directly on Ardour buffers.
 * The drawback is that there is no thread safety:
 * All calls need to be executed in the same thread.
 *
 * After configuration, the delay can be changed safely up to the maximum
 * configured delay but doing so flushes the buffer. There is no de-clicking
 * (see ARDOUR::Delayline for those cases).
 *
 * Increasing the delay above the max configured or requesting more
 * buffers will allocate the required space (not realtime safe).
 *
 * All buffers part of the set are treated separately.
