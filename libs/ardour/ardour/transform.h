/** Transform notes with a user-defined transformation.
 *
 * This is essentially an interpreter for a simple concatenative note
 * transformation language (as an AST only, no source code).  A "program"
 * calculates a note property value from operations on literal values, and/or
 * values from the current or previous note in the sequence.  This allows
 * simple things like "set all notes' velocity to 64" or transitions over time
 * like "set velocity to the previous note's velocity + 10".
 *
 * The language is forth-like: everything is on a stack, operations pop their
 * arguments from the stack and push their result back on to it.
 *
 * This is a sweet spot between simplicity and power, it should be simple to
 * use this (with perhaps some minor extensions) to do most "linear-ish"
 * transformations, though it could be extended to have random access
 * and more special values as the need arises.
