/** A stub Processor that can be used in place of a `real' one that cannot be
 *  created for some reason; usually because it requires a plugin which is not
 *  present.  UnknownProcessors are special-cased in a few places, notably
 *  in route configuration and signal processing, so that on encountering them
 *  configuration or processing stops.
 *
 *  When a Processor is missing from a Route, the following processors cannot
 *  be configured, as the missing Processor's output port configuration is
 *  unknown.
 *
 *  The main utility of the UnknownProcessor is that it allows state
 *  to be preserved, so that, for example, loading and re-saving a
 *  session on a machine without a particular plugin will not corrupt
 *  the session.
