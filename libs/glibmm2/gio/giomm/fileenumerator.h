/** Enumerated Files Routines.
 * FileEnumerator allows you to operate on a set of Gio::Files, returning a Gio::FileInfo instance for each file enumerated 
 * (e.g. Gio::File::enumerate_children() will return a FileEnumerator for each of the children within a directory).
 *
 * To get the next file's information from a Gio::FileEnumerator, use next_file() or its asynchronous version, next_file_async(). 
 * Note that the asynchronous version will return a list of Gio::FileInfos, whereas the synchronous version will only return the next 
 * file in the enumerator.
 *
 * To close a Gio::FileEnumerator, use FileEnumerator::close(), or its asynchronous version, close_async(). Once a FileEnumerator is closed, 
 * no further actions may be performed on it.
