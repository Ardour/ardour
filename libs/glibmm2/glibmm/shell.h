 * anything that the shell would.  Both single and double quotes are handled,
 * as are escapes including escaped newlines.
 *
 * Shell quoting rules are a bit strange.  Single quotes preserve the literal
 * string exactly.  Escape sequences are not allowed; not even <tt>\\'</tt> --
 * if you want a <tt>'</tt> in the quoted text, you have to do something like
 * <tt>'foo'\\''bar'</tt>.  Double quotes allow <tt>$</tt>, <tt>`</tt>,
 * <tt>"</tt>, <tt>\\</tt>, and newline to be escaped with backslash.
 * Otherwise double quotes preserve things literally.
