/** A widget which controls the alignment and size of its child.
 *
 * Normally, a widget is allocated at least as much size as it requests, and,
 * most widgets expand to fill any extra allocated space, but sometimes
 * this behavior is not desired. The alignment widget allows the
 * programmer to specify how a widget should expand and position itself
 * to fill the area it is allocated.
 *
 * It has four settings: xscale, yscale, xalign, and yalign:
 * The scale settings specify how much the child widget should expand to fill the space allocated to the Gtk::Alignment. The values can range from 0 (meaning the child doesn't expand at all) to 1 (meaning the child expands to fill all of the available space).
 * The align settings place the child widget within the available area. The values range from 0 (top or left) to 1 (bottom or right). Of course, if the scale settings are both set to 1, the alignment settings have no effect.
