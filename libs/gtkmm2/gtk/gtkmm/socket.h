/** Container for widgets from other processes.
 * Together with Gtk::Plug, Gtk::Socket provides the ability to embed
 * widgets from one process into another process in a fashion that is
 * transparent to the user. One process creates a Gtk::Socket widget and,
 * passes the that widget's window ID to the other process, which then
 * creates a Gtk::Plug with that window ID. Any widgets contained in the
 * Gtk::Plug then will appear inside the first applications window.
 *
 * The socket's window ID is obtained by using get_id(). Before using this
 * function, the socket must have been realized, and for hence, have been
 * added to its parent.
 *
 * @code
 * Gtk::Socket socket;
 * parent.add(socket);
 *
 * // The following call is only necessary if one of the ancestors of the
 * // socket is not yet visible
 * socket.realize();
 *
 * cout << "The ID of the sockets window is: " << socket.get_id() << endl;
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note that if you pass the window ID of the socket to another process that
 * will create a plug in the socket, you must make sure that the socket
 * widget is not destroyed until that plug is created. Violating this rule
 * will cause unpredictable consequences, the most likely consequence being
 * that the plug will appear as a separate toplevel window. You can check if
 * the plug has been created by examining the plug_window member of the
 * GtkSocket structure returned by gobj(). If this field is non-NULL, then
 * the plug has been successfully created inside of the socket.
 *
 * When gtkmm is notified that the embedded window has been destroyed, then
 * it will destroy the socket as well. You should always, therefore, be
 * prepared for your sockets to be destroyed at any time when the main event
 * loop is running.
 *
 * The communication between a Gtk::Socket and a Gtk::Plug follows the
 * XEmbed protocol. This protocol has also been implemented in other
 * toolkits, e.g. Qt, allowing the same level of integration when embedding
 * a Qt widget in gtkmm or vice versa.
