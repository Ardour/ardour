/** Typedefed as Gtk::TextBuffer::Tag.
 *
 * Text in a buffer can be marked with tags. A tag is an attribute that can be applied to some range of text. For example, a tag
 * might be called "bold" and might make the text inside the tag bold. However, the tag concept is more general than that; tags don't
 * have to affect appearance. They can instead affect the behavior of mouse and key presses, "lock" a range of text so the user
 * can't edit it, or countless other things.
 * One tag can be applied to any number of text ranges in any number of @link Gtk::TextBuffer Gtk::TextBuffers@endlink.
 *
 * Each tag is stored in a @link Gtk::TextTagTable Gtk::TextBuffer::TagTable@endlink, and Tags should be in the
 * @link Gtk::TextTagTable Gtk::TextBuffer::TagTable@endlink for a given Gtk::TextBuffer before using
 * them with that buffer.
 *
 * Tags can have names, which is convenient sometimes (for example, you can name your tag that makes things bold "bold"), but
 * they can also be anonymous (which is convenient if you're creating tags on-the-fly). 
 *
 * Gtk::TextBuffer::create_tag() is the best way to create tags. See the demo for numerous examples.
