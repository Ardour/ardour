  /** Asks the window manager to move
   *  @a window  to the given position.  %Window managers are free to ignore
   * this; most window managers ignore requests for initial window
   * positions (instead using a user-defined placement algorithm) and
   * honor requests after the window has already been shown.
   * 
   * @note the position is the position of the gravity-determined
   * reference point for the window. The gravity determines two things:
   * first, the location of the reference point in root window
   * coordinates; and second, which point on the window is positioned at
   * the reference point.
   * 
   * By default the gravity is Gdk::GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST, so the reference
   * point is simply the @a x , @a y  supplied to move(). The
   * top-left corner of the window decorations (aka window frame or
   * border) will be placed at @a x , @a y .  Therefore, to position a window
   * at the top left of the screen, you want to use the default gravity
   * (which is Gdk::GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST) and move the window to 0,0.
   * 
   * To position a window at the bottom right corner of the screen, you
   * would set Gdk::GRAVITY_SOUTH_EAST, which means that the reference
   * point is at @a x  + the window width and @a y  + the window height, and
   * the bottom-right corner of the window border will be placed at that
   * reference point. So, to place a window in the bottom right corner
   * you would first set gravity to south east, then write:
   * <tt>gtk_window_move (window, gdk_screen_width() - window_width,
   * gdk_screen_height() - window_height)</tt>.
   * 
   * The Extended Window Manager Hints specification at 
   * http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec has a 
   * nice table of gravities in the "implementation notes" section.
   * 
   * The get_position() documentation may also be relevant.
   * @param x X coordinate to move window to.
   * @param y Y coordinate to move window to.
   */
  void move(int x, int y);

  
  /** This function returns the position you need to pass to
   * move() to keep @a window  in its current position.  This
   * means that the meaning of the returned value varies with window
   * gravity. See move() for more details.
   * 
   * If you haven't changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
   * Gdk::GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that get_position()
   * gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager
   * frame for the window. move() sets the position of this
   * same top-left corner.
   * 
   * get_position() is not 100% reliable because the X&nbsp;%Window System
   * does not specify a way to obtain the geometry of the
   * decorations placed on a window by the window manager.
   * Thus GTK+ is using a "best guess" that works with most
   * window managers.
   * 
   * Moreover, nearly all window managers are historically broken with
   * respect to their handling of window gravity. So moving a window to
   * its current position as returned by get_position() tends
   * to result in moving the window slightly. %Window managers are
   * slowly getting better over time.
   * 
   * If a window has gravity Gdk::GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager
   * frame is not relevant, and thus get_position() will
   * always produce accurate results. However you can't use static
   * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
   * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
   * 
   * If you are saving and restoring your application's window
   * positions, you should know that it's impossible for applications to
   * do this without getting it somewhat wrong because applications do
   * not have sufficient knowledge of window manager state. The Correct
   * Mechanism is to support the session management protocol (see the
   * "GnomeClient" object in the GNOME libraries for example) and allow
   * the window manager to save your window sizes and positions.
   * @param root_x Return location for X coordinate of gravity-determined reference point.
   * @param root_y Return location for Y coordinate of gravity-determined reference point.

   * manual page for X (type 'man X') for details on this.
   * parse_geometry() does work on all GTK+ ports
   * including Win32 but is primarily intended for an X environment.
   * 
   * If either a size or a position can be extracted from the
   * geometry string, parse_geometry() returns <tt>true</tt>
   * and calls set_default_size() and/or move()
