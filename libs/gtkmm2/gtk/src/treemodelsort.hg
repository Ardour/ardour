/** A wrapper which makes an underlying Gtk::TreeModel sortable.
 *
 * The TreeModelSort is a model which implements the TreeSortable interface. 
 * It does not hold any data itself, but rather is created with
 * a child model and proxies its data.  It has identical column types to
 * this child model, and the changes in the child are propagated.  The
 * primary purpose of this model is to provide a way to sort a different
 * model without modifying it. Note that the sort function used by
 * TreeModelSort is not guaranteed to be stable. 
 *
 * For instance, you might create two TreeView widgets each with a
 * view of the same data.  If the model is wrapped by a
 * TreeModelSort then the two TreeViews can each sort their
 * view of the data without affecting the other.  By contrast, if we
 * simply put the same model in each widget, then sorting the first would
 * sort the second.
