   @brief libltc - en+decode linear timecode

   Linear (or Longitudinal) Timecode (LTC) is an encoding of
   timecode data as a Manchester-Biphase encoded audio signal.
   The audio signal is commonly recorded on a VTR track or other
   storage media.

   libltc facilitates decoding and encoding of LTC from/to
   timecode, including SMPTE date support.

/**
 * Raw 80 bit LTC frame
 *
 * The datastream for each video frame of Longitudinal Timecode consists of eighty bit-periods.
 *
 * At a frame-rate of 30 fps, the bit-rate corresponds to 30 [fps] * 80 [bits/f] = 2400 bits per second.
 * The frequency for a stream of zeros would be 1.2 kHz and for a stream of ones it would be 2.4 kHz.
 * \image html smptefmt.png
 * With all commonly used video-frame-rates and audio-sample-rates,  LTC timecode can be recorded
 * easily into a audio-track.
 *
 * In each frame, 26 of the eighty bits carry the SMPTE time in binary coded decimal (BCD).
 *
 * These Bits are FRAME-UNITS, FRAME-TENS, SECS-UNITS, SECS-TENS, MINS-UNITS, MINS-TENS, HOURS-UNITS and HOURS-TENS.
 * The BCD digits are loaded 'least significant bit first' (libltc takes care of the architecture specific alignment).
 *
 * 32 bits are assigned as eight groups of four USER-BITS (also sometimes called the "Binary Groups").
 * This capacity is generally used to carry extra info such as reel number and/or date.
 * The User Bits may be allocated howsoever one wishes as long as both Binary Group Flag Bits are cleared.
 *
 * The function \ref ltc_frame_to_time can interpret the user-bits as SMPTE Date+Timezone according to SMPTE 309M-1999.
 * similarly \ref ltc_time_to_frame will do the reverse.
 *
 * The last 16 Bits make up the SYNC WORD. These bits indicate the frame boundary, the tape direction, and the bit-rate of the sync tone.
 * The values of these Bits are fixed as 0011 1111 1111 1101
 *
 * The Bi-Phase Mark Phase Correction Bit (Bit 27 or 59) may be set or cleared so that that every 80-bit word
 * contains an even number of zeroes. This means that the phase of the pulse train in every Sync Word will be the same.
 *
 * Bit 10 indicates drop-frame timecode.
 * The Colour Frame Flag col.frm is Bit 11; if the timecode intentionally synchronized to a colour TV field sequence, this bit is set.
 *
 * Bit 58 is not required for the BCD count for HOURS-TENS (which has a maximum value of two)
 * and has not been given any other special purpose so remains unassigned.
 * This Bit has been RESERVED for future assignment.
 *
 * The Binary Group Flag Bits (bits 43 and 59) are two bits indicate the format of the User Bits data.
 * SMPTE 12M-1999 defines the previously reserved bit 58 to signals that the time is locked to wall-clock
 * within a tolerance of ± 0.5 seconds.
 *
 * SMPTE 12M-1999 also changes the numbering schema of the BGF. (BGF1 was renamed to BGF2 and bit 58 becomes BGFB1)
 *
 * To further complicate matters, the BGFB assignment as well as the biphase_mark_phase_correction (aka parity)
 * bit depends on the timecode-format used.
 *
 * <pre>
 *          25 fps   24, 30 fps
 *  BGF0      27        43
 *  BGF1      58        58
 *  BGF2      43        59
 *  Parity    59        27
 * </pre>
 *
 * The variable naming chosen for the LTCFrame struct is based on the 24,30 fps standard.
 *
 * The Binary Group Flag Bits should be used only as shown in the truth table below.
 * The Unassigned entries in the table should not be used, as they may be allocated specific meanings in the future.
 *

 *
 * (1) ISO/IEC 646 or ISO/IEC 2022 character set.
 * If the seven-bit ISO codes are being used, they shall be converted to
 * eight-bit codes by setting the eighth bit to zero. 4 ISO codes can be encoded,
 * user7 and user8 are to be used for the first code with LSB 7 and MSB in 8.
 * the remaining ISO codes are to be distributed in the same manner to
 * user5/6 user3/4 and user1/2 accordingly.
 *
 * (2) The Page/Line indicates ANSI/SMPTE-262M is used for the user-bits. It is multiplex system that
 * can be used to encode large amounts of data in the binary groups through the use of time multiplexing.
 *
 * libltc does not use any of the BGF - except for the Parity bit which can be calculated and set with
 * \ref ltc_frame_set_parity. Setting and interpreting the BGF is left to the application using libltc.
 * However libltc provides functionality to parse or set date and timezoe according to SMPTE 309M-1999.
