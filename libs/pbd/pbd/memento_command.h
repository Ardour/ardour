/** A class that can return a Stateful object which is the subject of a MementoCommand.
 *
 *  The existence of this class means that the undo record can refer to objects which
 *  don't exist in the session file.  Currently this is used for
 *
 *  1.  MIDI automation; when MIDI automation is edited, undo records are
 *  written for the AutomationList being changed.  However this AutomationList
 *  is a temporary structure, built by a MidiModel, which doesn't get written
 *  to the session file.  Hence we need to be able to go from a MidiSource and
 *  Parameter to an AutomationList.  This Binder mechanism allows this through
 *  MidiAutomationListBinder; the undo record stores the source and parameter,
 *  and these are bound to an AutomationList by the Binder.
 *
 *  2.  Crossfades; unlike regions, these are completely removed from a session
 *  when they are deleted.  This means that the undo record can contain
 *  references to non-existant crossfades.  To get around this, CrossfadeBinder
 *  can do `just-in-time' binding from the crossfade ID.
