/** An RCUManager is an object which takes over management of a pointer to another object.
 *
 * It provides three key methods:
 *
 * - reader()     : obtains a shared pointer to the managed object that may be used for reading, without synchronization
 * - write_copy() : obtains a shared pointer to the object that may be used for writing/modification
 * - update()     : accepts a shared pointer to a (presumed) modified instance of the object and causes all
 *                  future reader() and write_copy() calls to use that instance.
 *
 * Any existing users of the value returned by reader() can continue to use their copy even as a write_copy()/update() takes place.
 * The RCU manager will manage the various instances of "the managed object" in a way that is transparent to users of the manager
 * and managed object.

/** Serialized RCUManager implements the RCUManager interface. It is based on the
 * following key assumption: among its users we have readers that are bound by
 * RT time constraints, and writers who are not. Therefore, we do not care how
 * slow the write_copy()/update() operations are, or what synchronization
 * primitives they use.
 *
 * Because of this design assumption, this class will serialize all
 * writers. That is, objects calling write_copy()/update() will be serialized by
 * a mutex. Only a single writer may be in the middle of write_copy()/update();
 * all other writers will block until the first has finished. The order of
 * execution of multiple writers if more than one is blocked in this way is
 * undefined.
 *
 * The class maintains a lock-protected "dead wood" list of old value of
 * *rcu_value (i.e. shared_ptr<T>). The list is cleaned up every time we call
 * write_copy(). If the list is the last instance of a shared_ptr<T> that
 * references the object (determined by shared_ptr::unique()) then we
 * erase it from the list, thus deleting the object it points to.  This is lazy
 * destruction - the SerializedRCUManager assumes that there will sufficient
 * calls to write_copy() to ensure that we do not inadvertently leave objects
 * around for excessive periods of time.
 *
 * For extremely well defined circumstances (i.e. it is known that there are no
 * other writer objects in existence), SerializedRCUManager also provides a
 * flush() method that will unconditionally clear out the "dead wood" list. It
 * must be used with significant caution, although the use of shared_ptr<T>
 * means that no actual objects will be deleted incorrectly if this is misused.
