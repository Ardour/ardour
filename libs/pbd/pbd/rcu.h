/** An RCUManager is an object which takes over management of a pointer to another object.

 * It provides three key methods:
 *
 * - reader()     : obtains a shared pointer to the managed object that may be used for reading, without synchronization
 * - write_copy() : obtains a shared pointer to the object that may be used for writing/modification
 * - update()     : accepts a shared pointer to a (presumed) modified instance of the object and causes all
 *                  future reader() and write_copy() calls to use that instance.
 *
 * Any existing users of the value returned by reader() can continue to use their copy even as a write_copy()/update() takes place.
 * The RCU manager will manage the various instances of "the managed object" in a way that is transparent to users of the manager
 * and managed object.

/** Serialized RCUManager implements the RCUManager interface. It is based on the
   following key assumption: among its users we have readers that are bound by
   RT time constraints, and writers who are not. Therefore, we do not care how
   slow the write_copy()/update() operations are, or what synchronization
   primitives they use.

   Because of this design assumption, this class will serialize all
   writers. That is, objects calling write_copy()/update() will be serialized by
   a mutex. Only a single writer may be in the middle of write_copy()/update();
   all other writers will block until the first has finished. The order of
   execution of multiple writers if more than one is blocked in this way is
   undefined.

   The class maintains a lock-protected "dead wood" list of old value of
   *m_rcu_value (i.e. shared_ptr<T>). The list is cleaned up every time we call
   write_copy(). If the list is the last instance of a shared_ptr<T> that
   references the object (determined by shared_ptr::unique()) then we
   erase it from the list, thus deleting the object it points to.  This is lazy
   destruction - the SerializedRCUManager assumes that there will sufficient
   calls to write_copy() to ensure that we do not inadvertently leave objects
   around for excessive periods of time.

   For extremely well defined circumstances (i.e. it is known that there are no
   other writer objects in existence), SerializedRCUManager also provides a
   flush() method that will unconditionally clear out the "dead wood" list. It
   must be used with significant caution, although the use of shared_ptr<T>
   means that no actual objects will be deleted incorrectly if this is misused.
