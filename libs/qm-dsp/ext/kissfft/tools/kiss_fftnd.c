Hi there!

If you're looking at this particular code, it probably means you've got a brain-dead bounds checker 
that thinks the above code overwrites the end of the array.

It doesn't.

-- Mark 

P.S.
The below code might give you some warm fuzzies and help convince you.

 This works by tackling one dimension at a time.

 In effect,
 Each stage starts out by reshaping the matrix into a DixSi 2d matrix.
 A Di-sized fft is taken of each column, transposing the matrix as it goes.

Here's a 3-d example:
Take a 2x3x4 matrix, laid out in memory as a contiguous buffer
 [ [ [ a b c d ] [ e f g h ] [ i j k l ] ]
   [ [ m n o p ] [ q r s t ] [ u v w x ] ] ]

Stage 0 ( D=2): treat the buffer as a 2x12 matrix
   [ [a b ... k l]
     [m n ... w x] ]

   FFT each column with size 2.
   Transpose the matrix at the same time using kiss_fft_stride.

   [ [ a+m a-m ]
     [ b+n b-n]
     ...
     [ k+w k-w ]
     [ l+x l-x ] ]

   Note fft([x y]) == [x+y x-y]

Stage 1 ( D=3) treats the buffer (the output of stage D=2) as an 3x8 matrix,
   [ [ a+m a-m b+n b-n c+o c-o d+p d-p ] 
     [ e+q e-q f+r f-r g+s g-s h+t h-t ]
     [ i+u i-u j+v j-v k+w k-w l+x l-x ] ]

   And perform FFTs (size=3) on each of the columns as above, transposing 
   the matrix as it goes.  The output of stage 1 is 
       (Legend: ap = [ a+m e+q i+u ]
                am = [ a-m e-q i-u ] )
   
   [ [ sum(ap) fft(ap)[0] fft(ap)[1] ]
     [ sum(am) fft(am)[0] fft(am)[1] ]
     [ sum(bp) fft(bp)[0] fft(bp)[1] ]
     [ sum(bm) fft(bm)[0] fft(bm)[1] ]
     [ sum(cp) fft(cp)[0] fft(cp)[1] ]
     [ sum(cm) fft(cm)[0] fft(cm)[1] ]
     [ sum(dp) fft(dp)[0] fft(dp)[1] ]
     [ sum(dm) fft(dm)[0] fft(dm)[1] ]  ]

Stage 2 ( D=4) treats this buffer as a 4*6 matrix,
   [ [ sum(ap) fft(ap)[0] fft(ap)[1] sum(am) fft(am)[0] fft(am)[1] ]
     [ sum(bp) fft(bp)[0] fft(bp)[1] sum(bm) fft(bm)[0] fft(bm)[1] ]
     [ sum(cp) fft(cp)[0] fft(cp)[1] sum(cm) fft(cm)[0] fft(cm)[1] ]
     [ sum(dp) fft(dp)[0] fft(dp)[1] sum(dm) fft(dm)[0] fft(dm)[1] ]  ]

   Then FFTs each column, transposing as it goes.

   The resulting matrix is the 3d FFT of the 2x3x4 input matrix.

   Note as a sanity check that the first element of the final 
   stage's output (DC term) is 
   sum( [ sum(ap) sum(bp) sum(cp) sum(dp) ] )
   , i.e. the summation of all 24 input elements.
