references in bind and group adaptors.

1.9.6:

* First public release of the unstable 2.0 generation.
  libsigc++ 2.0 uses modern C++ mechanisms to achieve a highly
  flexible, yet typesafe callback system. It supports all features of
  libsigc++ 1.2 and improves upon it by:
  - No need to specify the number of arguments in signal definitions.
  - Connection of any compatible (=implicitly convertable) functor
   to a signal.
  - Implicit type conversions of parameters during signal emission.
  - Lambda adaptor for complete restructuring of functor parameter
   lists in one line (subject to changes).
  - Signal has a fully featured stl style list interface.
  - A convinient accumulator API (replacing the old marshaller API).
  - Removal of unnecessary memory management functionality.
  - Lightweight class "trackable" for use as base class of your
   class hierarchy replaces class "Object".
