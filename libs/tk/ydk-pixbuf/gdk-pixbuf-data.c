/**
 * gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data:
 * @data: (array): Image data in 8-bit/sample packed format
 * @colorspace: Colorspace for the image data
 * @has_alpha: Whether the data has an opacity channel
 * @bits_per_sample: Number of bits per sample
 * @width: Width of the image in pixels, must be > 0
 * @height: Height of the image in pixels, must be > 0
 * @rowstride: Distance in bytes between row starts
 * @destroy_fn: (scope async) (allow-none): Function used to free the data when the pixbuf's reference count
 * drops to zero, or %NULL if the data should not be freed
 * @destroy_fn_data: (closure): Closure data to pass to the destroy notification function
 * 
 * Creates a new #GdkPixbuf out of in-memory image data.  Currently only RGB
 * images with 8 bits per sample are supported.
 *
 * Since you are providing a pre-allocated pixel buffer, you must also
 * specify a way to free that data.  This is done with a function of
 * type #GdkPixbufDestroyNotify.  When a pixbuf created with is
 * finalized, your destroy notification function will be called, and
 * it is its responsibility to free the pixel array.
 *
 * See also gdk_pixbuf_new_from_bytes().
 *
 * Return value: (transfer full): A newly-created #GdkPixbuf structure with a reference count of 1.
