/* Types of images.
 *   Normal: Normal X image type. These are slow as they involve passing
 *	     the entire image through the X connection each time a draw
 *	     request is required. On Win32, a bitmap.
 *   Shared: Shared memory X image type. These are fast as the X server
 *	     and the program actually use the same piece of memory. They
 *	     should be used with care though as there is the possibility
 *	     for both the X server and the program to be reading/writing
 *	     the image simultaneously and producing undesired results.
 *	     On Win32, also a bitmap.
