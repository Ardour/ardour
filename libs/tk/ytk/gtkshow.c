/**
 * gtk_show_uri:
 * @screen: (allow-none): screen to show the uri on or %NULL for the default screen
 * @uri: the uri to show
 * @timestamp: a timestamp to prevent focus stealing.
 * @error: a #GError that is returned in case of errors
 *
 * This is a convenience function for launching the default application
 * to show the uri. The uri must be of a form understood by GIO (i.e. you
 * need to install gvfs to get support for uri schemes such as http://
 * or ftp://, as only local files are handled by GIO itself).
 * Typical examples are
 * <simplelist>
 *   <member><filename>file:///home/gnome/pict.jpg</filename></member>
 *   <member><filename>http://www.gnome.org</filename></member>
 *   <member><filename>mailto:me&commat;gnome.org</filename></member>
 * </simplelist>
 * Ideally the timestamp is taken from the event triggering
 * the gtk_show_uri() call. If timestamp is not known you can take
 * %GDK_CURRENT_TIME.
 *
 * This function can be used as a replacement for gnome_vfs_url_show()
 * and gnome_url_show().
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE on success, %FALSE on error.
 *
 * Since: 2.14
