/** Registers a new accelerator with the global accelerator map.
 * This function should only be called once per accel_path
 * with the canonical accel_key and accel_mods for this path.
 * To change the accelerator during runtime programatically, use
 * change_entry().
 * The accelerator path must consist of "&lt;WINDOWTYPE&gt;/Category1/Category2/.../Action",
 * where &lt;<WINDOWTYPE&gt; should be a unique application-specific identifier, that
 * corresponds to the kind of window the accelerator is being used in, e.g. "Gimp-Image",
 * "Abiword-Document" or "Gnumeric-Settings".
 * The Category1/.../Action portion is most appropriately chosen by the action the
 * accelerator triggers, i.e. for accelerators on menu items, choose the item's menu path,
 * e.g. "File/Save As", "Image/View/Zoom" or "Edit/Select All".
 * So a full valid accelerator path may look like:
 * "<Gimp-Toolbox>/File/Dialogs/Tool Options...".
