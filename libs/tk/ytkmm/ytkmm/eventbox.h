   * In an invisible window event box, the window that the
   * event box creates is a Gdk::INPUT_ONLY window, which 
   * means that it is invisible and only serves to receive
   * events.
   * 
   * A visible window event box creates a visible (Gdk::INPUT_OUTPUT)
   * window that acts as the parent window for all the widgets  
   * contained in the event box.
   * 
   * You should generally make your event box invisible if
   * you just want to trap events. Creating a visible window
   * may cause artifacts that are visible to the user, especially
   * if the user is using a theme with gradients or pixmaps.
   * 
   * The main reason to create a non input-only event box is if
   * you want to set the background to a different color or
   * draw on it.
   * 
   * \note
   * There is one unexpected issue for an invisible event box that has its
   * window below the child. (See set_above_child().)
   * Since the input-only window is not an ancestor window of any windows
   * that descendent widgets of the event box create, events on these 
   * windows aren't propagated up by the windowing system, but only by GTK+.
   * The practical effect of this is if an event isn't in the event
   * mask for the descendant window (see Gtk::Widget::add_events()),  
   * it won't be received by the event box. 
   * 
	 * \note
   * This problem doesn't occur for visible event boxes, because in
   * that case, the event box window is actually the ancestor of the
   * descendant windows, not just at the same place on the screen.
