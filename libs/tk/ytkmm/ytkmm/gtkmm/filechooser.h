/**
 * Gtk::FileChooser is an interface that can be implemented by file selection
 * widgets. In gtkmm, the main objects that implement this interface are
 * FileChooserWidget and FileChooserDialog. You do not need to write an
 * object that implements the FileChooser interface unless you are trying to
 * adapt an existing file selector to expose a standard programming interface.
 *
 * @par File Names and Encodings
 * When the user is finished selecting files in a FileChooser, your program
 * can get the selected names either as filenames or as URIs. For URIs, the
 * normal escaping rules are applied if the URI contains non-ASCII characters.
 * However, filenames are always returned in the character set specified by the
 * G_FILENAME_ENCODING environment variable. Please see the Glib documentation
 * for more details about this variable.
 *
 * @par Important
 * This means that while you can pass the result of FileChooser::get_filename()
 * to <tt>open(2)</tt> or <tt>fopen(3)</tt>, you may not be able to directly
 * set it as the text of a Gtk::Label widget unless you convert it first to
 * UTF-8, which all gtkmm widgets expect. You should use
 * Glib::filename_to_utf8() to convert filenames into strings that can be
 * passed to gtkmm widgets.
 *
 * @note
 * The gtkmm FileChooser API is broken in that methods return Glib::ustring
 * even though the returned string is not necessarily UTF-8 encoded.  Any
 * FileChooser method that takes or returns a filename (not a URI) should
 * have std::string as parameter or return type.  Fortunately this mistake
 * doesn't prevent you from handling filenames correctly in your application.
 * Just pretend that the API uses std::string and call Glib::filename_to_utf8()
 * or Glib::filename_from_utf8() as appropriate.
 *
 * See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142138 for more information.
