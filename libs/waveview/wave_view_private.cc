/* Notes on thread/sync design:
 *
 *
 * the worker threads do not hold the _queue_mutex while doing work. This means
 * that an attempt to signal them using a condition variable and the
 * _queue_mutex is not guaranteed to work - they may not be either (a) holding
 * the lock or (b) waiting on condition variable (having gone to sleep on the
 * mutex).
 *
 * Instead, when the signalling thread takes the mutex, they may be busy
 * working, and will therefore miss the signal.
 *
 * This is fine for handling requests - worker threads will just loop around,
 * check the request queue again, and behave appropriately (i.e. do more more
 * work, or go to sleep waiting on condition variable.
 *
 * But it's not fine when we need to tell the threads to quit. We can't do this
 * with requests, because there's no way to ensure that each thread will pick
 * up a request. So we have a bool member, _quit, which we set to indicate
 * that threads should exit. This integer is protected by the _queue_mutex. If
 * it was not (and was instead just an atomic integer), we would get a race
 * condition where a worker thread checks _quit, finds it is still false, then
 * takes the mutex in order to check the request queue, gets blocked there
 * because a signalling thread has acquired the mutex (and broadcasts the
 * condition), then the worker continues (now holding the mutex), finds no
 * requests, and goes to sleep, never to be woken again.
 *
 *      Signalling Thread                 Worker Thread
 *      =================                 =============
 *                                        _quit == true ? => false
 *      _quit = true
 *      acquire _queue_mutex
 *      cond.broadcast()                  acquire _queue_mutex => sleep
 *      release _queue_mutex              sleep
 *                                        wake
 *                                        check request queue => empty
 *                                        sleep on cond, FOREVER
 *
 * This was the design until 166ac63924c2b. Now we acquire the mutex in the
 * classic thread synchronization manner, and there is no race:
 *
 *      Signalling Thread                 Worker Thread
 *      =================                 =============
 *
 *      acquire _queue_mutex              acquire _queue_mutex => sleep
 *      _quit = true
 *      release _queue_mutex
 *      cond.broadcast()
 *      release _queue_mutex
 *                                        wake
 *                                        _quit == true ? => true
 *                                        exit
 *
 * If worker threads held the mutex while working, a slightly different design
 * would be correct, but because there is a single queue protected by the
 * mutex, that would effectively serialize all worker threads which would be
 * pointless.
