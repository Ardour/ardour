	<title>Basic Editing</title>
	<para>
		Once you have recorded or imported the material that will make up a
		session/piece/composition, it will generally become time to
		<emphasis>edit</emphasis> it. You can add/remove material at any time,
		and/or modify the mix if you desire. But editing tends to be a distinct
		focus during the "middle" part of working on an arrangement, and has its own
		particular set of tools and approaches. This section of the manual covers
		the editing tools you will probably use all the time; see <xref linkend="ch-advanced-editing"/>
		for coverage of more specialized tools and techniques.
