    A track can be deactivated from the track context menu which is accessed
    by clicking on the empty space in the &TRACK_CONTROLS; and choosing the
    <guimenuitem>Active</guimenuitem> menu item. A track can also be made
    inactive from the track name button in a &MIXER_STRIP;.

    <caption>
      <para>
        The &TRACK_CONTROLS; and &MIXER_STRIP; of inactive tracks have a
        different background color to differenciate them from active tracks.

  <para>
    Deactivating a track will silence it and reduce the amount of system
    resources required to operate the session. An inactive Audio Track will
    not read audio data from disk, unlike when a track is
    <link linkend="sn-muting-tracks">muted</link>.
