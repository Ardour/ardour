	<title>Default Track Names</title>
	<para>
		When a track is added to the session it is given a default name based on the
		Track type. For example, the first audio track that is added to the session
		will be given the name <literal>Audio 1</literal> and the first bus will be
		called <literal>Bus 1</literal> and any subsequently added tracks will be
		consecutively numbered.
	</para>

	<para>
		Track names determine the names of the files created when recording to a
		track so it is suggested that meaningful names are given to tracks, see
		<xref linkend="renaming-tracks"/>
	</para>
