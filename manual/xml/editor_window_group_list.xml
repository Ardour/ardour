	<title>Edit Group List</title>
	<para>
		Below the track list is the edit group list, which lists all edit groups for
		the session, including a default group called &#8220;all&#8221;. To the left
		of each group name is a checkbox which indicates whether or not the group is
		active (a checkmark means its active). Click on the checkbox to change the
		active status of an edit group.
	</para>

	<para>
		The edit group list can also be used to toggle the visibility of all members
		of the group. Visible edit groups are displayed in cyan, hidden ones in
		orange. Click on the name of the edit group to toggle its visibility. Note
		that an edit group can be visible and yet have hidden member tracks, and
		vice versa.
