		This chapter covers basic management of tracks. Tracks are probably the most

		<title>Deleting Tracks</title>
		<para>
			Deleting a track is permanent operation that cannot be undone. However,
			since the audio, MIDI, automation and other data associated with the track
			will remain as part of the session, and the actual playlist(s) that were in
			use by the track are still available. for use by other tracks. As a result,
			although inadvertently deleting a track is inconvenient, it doesn't result
			in any significant loss of information.

		<title>Soloing Tracks</title>
		<para>
			"Soloing" a track refers to changing some aspect of the signal flow through
			Ardour that makes it possible to listen to one (or just a few) tracks at a
			time. It is often done during mixing and mastering to help an audio
			engineer listen carefully to parts of the mix.
		</para>

		<para>
			Tracks may be soloed at any time. When one or more tracks are soloed, all
			non-soloedntracks will no longer be audible.
		</para>

		<para>
			Soloing tracks does not affect the solo status of busses, nor vice versa.
			That is, soloing a track leaves all busses audible and soloing a track
			leaves all tracks "audible". You may not actually be able to hear the
			"audible" material if it is routed through a non-soloed bus.
		</para>

		<para>
			This design is intended to allow FX busses and master outs to be useful
			even when soloing. Soloing is made significantly more complex by the
			presence of control outs (see control_outs_soloing for more details on
			soloing with control outs).
		</para>

		<section id="rude-solo-light">
			<title>Rude Solo Light</title>

				Whenever one or more tracks are soloed, the "rude solo light" in the
