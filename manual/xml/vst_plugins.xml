      The owners of VST (Steinberg Technologies, now owned by Yamaha) give
      VST away to developers for free. Sounds great, but they do not those
      same developers the ability to pass what they get from Steinberg on to
      other developers.
    </para>

    <para>
      This conflicts with the terms of the license for Ardour and several
      software libraries used by Ardour. Steinberg have said quite often
      that they are not opposed in principle to changing their license to
      allow redistribution, but as of mid-summer 2006, it has not happened
      yet.
    </para>

    <para>
      All of this means that it is <emphasis>illegal</emphasis> for anyone
      to distribute a binary (ready-to-run) version of Ardour with support
      for VST plugins built in. If you want to use Ardour with VST plugins,
      you must <emphasis>compile it yourself</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para>
      This is not a trivial undertaking; see our <emphasis>build
      page</emphasis> for a full explanation even without VST support. This
      page documents some more required steps for the build if you want to
      include VST support.
