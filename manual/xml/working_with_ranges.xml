		<title>Bounce Range</title>
		<para>
			Currently, when bouncing a range to disk, files corresponding to each
			channel of the range's output are created. The file names begin with Audio,
			then the track number followed by ".1." Then, a 0 or 1 is added, depending
			on the channel. Finally, the file extension is added. The file type is
			determined by the native format selection in the options editor (the
			Paths/Files tab).
		</para>

		<para>
			In a future version, "bounce range" will replace the range with a new
			region based on the bounced audio file which will include track FX, etc.
			Currently, no dialog box is offered to allow the user to name the bounced
			file or choose its location on disk. The bounced audio is just placed in
			the sounds directory of the project directory. There is currently no visual
			feedback that the bounce has been accomplished.
