<!-- Warning! This map has no bindings to Midimix's volume knobs. Why? Because Ardour has no built-in equalizer in its mixer. Maybe it was good to bind Midimix's knobs to "drive" knobs and pans, but you better bind it to whatever action you want with Midi Learning. Or use "EQ Mode" map. --> 

<!-- "Send all" button is not used here at all. Keep that in mind -->

<!-- The following binds Midimix's faders and mute/rec buttons to first eight tracks in Ardour. Note: "Solo" button on MidiMix will solo all tracks in current bank. It's useful when you have more than 8 tracks in a session. If you want to keep only one track in solo mode - press solo and then mute other tracks in that bank with "Mute" buttons. -->
