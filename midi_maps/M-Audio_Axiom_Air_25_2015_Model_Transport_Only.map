<!-- Based on file by Chooch Schubert -->
<!-- Simplified and updated by Guy Sherman in Jan 2016 -->

<!-- NB: loop-toggle and Transport/Record are a bit weird out-of-the-box: it will only stay enabled while you press the button -->
<!-- To fix them: reconfigure the record button from a Momentary switch to a Toggle switch as in ... -->
<!-- the user-manual describes how to set this up and save this into the keyboard's persistent memory -->
<!-- "If you want the button to send the same value every time you press it, simply set the same value for both Data 2 and Data 3" -->
