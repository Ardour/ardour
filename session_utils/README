Ardour Session Utilities
========================

This folder contains some tools which directly use libardour to access ardour
sessions.

The overall goal it to provide some non-interactive unix-style commandline
tools, which are installed along with DAW.

These tools depend on the "dummy" backend to be available, configure ardour with e.g.

  ./waf configure --with-backends=jack,alsa,dummy ...


Adding new tools
----------------

One C++ source per tool, see "example.cc" and "export.cc"

  cp session_utils/example.cc session_utils/your_new_tool_name.cc
  edit session_utils/new_tool_name.cc
  ./waf

The tool is automatically compiled and deployed when installing, using the
program-name as prefix.  e.g.  "export.cc" becomes "ardour4-export".
(or "mixbus3-export", depending on the project configuration)


Test run from the source
------------------------

  cd session_utils
  ./run ardour6-your_new_tool_name

or

  ./run ardour6-export --help

and to debug the tool under gdb/lldb:

  ./debug ardour6-export
