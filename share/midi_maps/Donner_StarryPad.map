<!-- Created 2023-07-14 by Albert GrÃ¤f. The Donner StarryPad is a cheap and
     cheerful 4x4 drum pad controller sold by Donner with some transport
     buttons, two faders (F1, F2), and two encoders (K1, K2), which makes it
     worthwhile to have it as a generic MIDI surface in Ardour.

     The map assigns the play/pause and rec buttons to the corresponding
     transport controls, F1/K1 to the selected track (gain/pan), and F2/K2 to
     the master bus (gain/pan). The A/B buttons of the device are mapped
     rather arbitrarily to the transport-start and loop-toggle functions for
     now. You may want to change these below, or comment them out if you
     prefer to assign them with MIDI learn instead. -->

<!-- Transport Control -->

<!-- NOTE: To make this work, you need to change the play/pause button with
     the StarryPad editor software so that it acts as a toggle switch (like
     the rec button does by default). This is the most reasonable setting
     anyway, and here we need it so that we can map this single button to both
     transport-roll and transport-stop. -->
