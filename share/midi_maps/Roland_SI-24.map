	<!-- EQ select buttons
	When the EQ/SEND button is activated, each of the EQ ON buttons activates/deactivates an individual band.  The two pan pots below each ON button now control the gain and frequency of the band (for example, if EQ 1 is activated, the pan pots from channels 1 and 2 become EQ 1 gain and EQ 1 frequency, respectively.  Pan pots 9-12 now control the levels going to sends 1-4.  The PLUG-IN button works similarly to EQ/SEND, but the parameters affected depend on the plugin being used.

	<!-- PROTOCOL buttons
	Simultaneously holding down the SYSTEM button and pressing one of the following buttons will change the SI-24's MIDI mapping to suit Logic, ProTools, Cubase, or two custom user presets.  No MIDI messages are generated during these 2-button combinations.  Without pressing SYSTEM, the buttons simply send the note values listed below (74-83).  In Logic, ProTools, and Cubase modes, all of the SI-24's buttons will send a Note-on followed by a Note-off when the button is released.  In the two user-defined modes, only a Note-on is sent.
