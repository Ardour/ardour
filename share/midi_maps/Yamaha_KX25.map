<!-- The KX25 uses 3 midiports. The first one are the control knobs and the keyboard itself, -->
<!-- The second port is used by the DAW REMOTE buttons, (except for the esc,return, and cursor keys, -->
<!-- those work the same as the ones on your typing keyboard!) and the third are the  midiconnections on the back of the KX. -->
<!-- Ergo, make sure you connect the 2nd midiport to your Ardour Control In port -->



<!-- Transport Controls. function="rec-enable" (or rec-disable, or both with the same note value)
     didn't toggle the record state on/off, while the OSC parameter "action=" did.      -->

<!-- Extra keys-->

<!-- keys Assign 1, Assign 2, Mute and Solo" . Since I didn't find a way to
     get the solo and mute working while selecting a track with action="Editor/select-prev( or next)-route"
     I assigned those keys to transport keys. A better solution for this solo/mute riddle is much appreciated! -->
