Bindings file for the Donner DMK25 Spacline controller. 

-----------------------------------------------------
Setting transport buttons to mode 1:
-----------------------------------------------------

The transport buttons in the unit work in two modes (toggle or latch). For this
file to work all buttons must be set to "mode 1" (latch, I think).

- press transpose+ and octave+ at the same time to enter edit mode, the four
	transpose and octave keys will light up.
- press the key labelled "mode" (middle D)

Now repeat for each transport control (loop, back, forward, stop, play, record):

- Press the transport button you want to set up, it will light up.
- Press the key labelled 1 (low C).

Finally:

- Press the key labelled "enter" to save (high C)

-----------------------------------------------------
Setting CC codes for transport buttons:
-----------------------------------------------------

CC messages in this file are the ones that come with the unit by default. 
If these need changing you can either change the "ctl" values in this file to 
the ones sent by your unit or change the values sent by your unit. If you
wish to do the latter follow these instructions:

- press transpose+ and octave+ at the same time to enter edit mode, all four
	transpose and octave keys will light up.
- press the key labelled "cc" (middle C)

Now repeat for each transport control:

- Press the transport button whose CC you want to change, it will light up.
- Use the number keys (low C to low A) to enter the CC code using three digits.

Finally:

- Press the key labelled "enter" to save (high C)
