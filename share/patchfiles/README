Please preserve the following when adding files here:

All documents except MIDI.midnam have the conventional naming scheme
Manufacturer_Model.midnam, with spaces replaced with underscores.

All documents validate against MIDINameDocument10.dtd.  Often the DOCTYPE needs
to be updated to the standard one, many old .midnam files use outdated versions
with broken links.

To validate a document, run:

xmllint --dtdvalid MIDINameDocument10.dtd Acme_Synthomatic.midnam > /dev/null

The same tool can be used to format the file nicely:

xmllint --format My_Device.ugly.midnam > Acme_Synthomatic.midnam
