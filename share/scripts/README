Script Naming conventions:

^_
 A script filename with a leading underscore indicates an example script.
 These scripts are only available from ardour's git repository and not
 installed nor included with binary bundles.

^__
 Scripts with a filename starting with two underscores are excluded from
 unit-tests.  This is currently the case for convolver, fluidsynth and
 plugin-modulation.
 They depend on external files (soundfont, impulse-response) or a specific
 session-setup (plugin-modulation needs an automatable plugin).

^s_
 A filename beginning with "s_" indicates a code snippet.
 These scripts can only be used in the interactive interpreter
 (Window > Scripting). They may be useful by themselves or handy for copy/edit
 to create EditorActions.
 The filename prefix is only for convenience, "type" = "Snippet" is used when
 scripts are listed at runtime.

^_-*.lua
 git ignores those. Intended for local/custom dev scripts or work in progress.
