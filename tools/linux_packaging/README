* Installing Ardour:

On most distributions, you can double-click the file "install.sh".

Alternatively, you can use a Terminal to run the installer.  Navigate
to the folder and run:
	
	./install.sh
	
The installer will ask for your root password (sudo/su), and copy the 
contents of the appropriate bundle (32-bit or 64-bit) to your /opt
folder. 


* Links and Menu entries:

In addition to installing the program, the installer will create:
1) A desktop link to launch the Ardour application
2) A menu entry in Gnome/KDE
3) An uninstall script in the /opt folder.


* Uninstaller:

To uninstall Ardour, run the uninstaller script in the /opt folder.
This will remove the app, desktop links, menu links, and
the uninstaller itself.


* Manual Installation:

If you would prefer to install Ardour in a custom location, then you
may simply unzip the appropriate package (32bit or 64bit) to your
preferred location and run the Ardour application from the "bin"
folder inside.
